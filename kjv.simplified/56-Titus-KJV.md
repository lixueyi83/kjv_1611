## Titus Chapter 1

<sup>**1**</sup>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;

<sup>**2**</sup>In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;

<sup>**3**</sup>But has in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;

<sup>**4**</sup>To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.

<sup>**5**</sup>For this cause left I you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you:

<sup>**6**</sup>If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.

<sup>**7**</sup>For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;

<sup>**8**</sup>But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;

<sup>**9**</sup>Holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.

<sup>**10**</sup>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:

<sup>**11**</sup>Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.

<sup>**12**</sup>One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, the Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.

<sup>**13**</sup>This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;

<sup>**14**</sup>Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.

<sup>**15**</sup>Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.

<sup>**16**</sup>They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.


## Titus Chapter 2

<sup>**1**</sup>But speak you the things which become sound doctrine:

<sup>**2**</sup>That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.

<sup>**3**</sup>The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becomes holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;

<sup>**4**</sup>That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,

<sup>**5**</sup>To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.

<sup>**6**</sup>Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.

<sup>**7**</sup>In all things shewing yourself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,

<sup>**8**</sup>Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.

<sup>**9**</sup>Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;

<sup>**10**</sup>Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.

<sup>**11**</sup>For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,

<sup>**12**</sup>Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;

<sup>**13**</sup>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;

<sup>**14**</sup>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.

<sup>**15**</sup>These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise you.


## Titus Chapter 3

<sup>**1**</sup>Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,

<sup>**2**</sup>To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.

<sup>**3**</sup>For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.

<sup>**4**</sup>But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,

<sup>**5**</sup>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;

<sup>**6**</sup>Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;

<sup>**7**</sup>That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

<sup>**8**</sup>This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that you affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.

<sup>**9**</sup>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.

<sup>**10**</sup>A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;

<sup>**11**</sup>Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sins, being condemned of himself.

<sup>**12**</sup>When I shall send Artemas unto you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.

<sup>**13**</sup>Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.

<sup>**14**</sup>And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.

<sup>**15**</sup>All that are with me salute you. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
