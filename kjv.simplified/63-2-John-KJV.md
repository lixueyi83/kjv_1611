# 2 John

<sup>**1**</sup>The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;

<sup>**2**</sup>For the truth's sake, which dwells in us, and shall be with us for ever.

<sup>**3**</sup>Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.

<sup>**4**</sup>I rejoiced greatly that I found of your children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.

<sup>**5**</sup>And now I beseech you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto you, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.

<sup>**6**</sup>And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it.

<sup>**7**</sup>For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.

<sup>**8**</sup>Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.

<sup>**9**</sup>Whosoever transgresses, and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son.

<sup>**10**</sup>If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:

<sup>**11**</sup>For he that bids him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.

<sup>**12**</sup>Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.

<sup>**13**</sup>The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.
